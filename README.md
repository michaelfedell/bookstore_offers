# Predictive Analytics 1 Project

An analysis of book sales by a German retailer as result of a special promotion
Analyzed data includes 33,713 customers and their purchases prior to Aug 1, 2014 when the promotion was put into effect.
A subset of 8311 customers will be used for training while the remaining 25,402 will be reserved for validation.
The goal is to predict the purchase amount of customers over the 3 months following the promotion.

The requirements of this project are further explained in the [attached PDF](project2018.pdf)

## Executive Summary

This paper discusses the strategy, methodology, and results of predicting customer
behavior in response to a promotional offer from an online bookseller. The most
important predictors for customer response likelihood relate to order date history,
frequency and recency of purchases, total amount spent, how long they’ve been
customers, and the amount spent on their largest order. When predicting amount of
sales, the key predictors are frequency of orders, maximum price spent on an order,
amount per order, total products purchased, and whether the customer purchased in
the past month.  The final models can be used to drive a marketing strategy which
will optimize short-term profit at a total payoff of €11850.89, or 34.2% of the
maximum payoff for the top 1516 responders.
