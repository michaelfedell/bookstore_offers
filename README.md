# Predictive Analytics 1 Project

An analysis of book sales by a German retailer as result of a special promotion
Analyzed data includes 33,713 customers and their purchases prior to Aug 1, 2014 when the promotion was put into effect.
A subset of 8311 customers will be used for training while the remaining 25,402 will be reserved for validation.
The goal is to predict the purchase amount of customers over the 3 months following the promotion.
